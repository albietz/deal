This Android app was build during the hackathon at Le Mobile 2012 in Paris.

The app scans receipts from Auchan supermarkets, using tesseract for OCR on a server (https://github.com/albietz/dealserver).
It should (in the future) also try to find the offers from Auchan's databases that are the most relevant to the products purchased by the user.
The app also shows some statistics of the purchases in a pie chart (not real data for now).
